# Arduino-Light-Show
IEEE Quarterly Project

Since the invention of lighting, our lives have improved greatly by allowing us to carry out activities at night. Besides the basic function of illumination, different types of lighting can also affect our mood and concentration. As technology advances and more “smart” gadgets are created, we should also consider making our lighting “smart”, either by making them able to react to the environment or improve its convenience. 
In our Arduino Light Show project, we aim to develop a product that shows that we can make our lights “smart” at a low cost of under 30$. It will have two modes: 
1.	The LED lights will be able to be turned on/off and change patterns by clapping, which shows that we are able to vastly improve the convenience of our lighting from a simple function. 

2.	The LED lights will blink according to a music input, and different lights will blink according to varying amplitudes. This shows that we can create a light source that is able to react to sound, which could be used for entertainment purposes. 
If we can develop a product that achieves these functions on a simple Arduino circuit on a breadboard, then there are endless possibilities of functions that can be applied to lighting on a larger budget. Concerts can have automated lights that match the music that is playing, and homes can be installed with convenient lighting systems that encourage energy savings.
